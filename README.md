# Pysch-Exp-data-analysis

** you will need Matlab and PsychToolbox downloaded to run this project

Created for the class "Visualizing Vision" at Brown University. This project contains several parts:

a) runSizeDistanceExperiment creates a visual experiment that will run on your computer screen. The experiment presents 2 shapes, side by side, and participants have to determine if they are the same shape or different shapes. I designed all visual stimuli for the experiment using Art of Illusion. These stimuli files are not included in this repo (so it cannot be run).

b) Text files. These files represent the data from 10 participants who all ran my experiment.

c) Matlab analysis. This file puts all the data from 10 participants in one array, analyzes it, and creates graphs based on the data. 

d) Labreport. The report shows a qualitative analysis of my results. It can also be used to better understand my experiment, the nature of it, and what I found.
